### To Be Noted
It's more convenient to use the custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. It incudes some libraries required for this course and saves you the hassle.  You can get the IDE from the University website <a href="http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2">here</a>.

### Update
I finished the course on Jul 30 2020 with 96% grade. View my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/4TVWVPVC96X4">certificate</a>.
